The [{scales} package](https://scales.r-lib.org/) was invented in part to allow users to adjust axes and scales in plots, including adjusting axes to account for logged values, but three have been some new developments in {scales} that have made existing answers (like [this one on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43710602/120898)) somewhat obsolete (e.g. the `trans_breaks()` and `trans_format()` functions used there are superceded and deprecated). \n\nSo here's a quick overview of how to use 2022-era {scales} to adjust axis breaks and labels to use both base 10 logs and natural logs. I'll use data from the Gapminder project, since it has a nice exponentially-distributed measure of GDP per capita.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(gapminder)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# Just look at one year\ngapminder_2007 <- gapminder |>\n  filter(year == 2007)\n\ntheme_set(theme_bw() + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Original unlogged values\n\nThe distribution of GDP per capita is heavily skewed, with most countries reporting less than $10,000. As a result, the scatterplot makes an upside-down L shape.

Instead of typing out every possible break, we can generate a list of numbers starting at 500 and then doubling ($500 \\times 2^0$, $500 \\times 2^1$, $500 \\times 2^2$, and so on):\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n500 * 2^seq(0, 8, by = 1)\n## [1]    500   1000   2000   4000   8000  16000  32000  64000 128000\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor bonus fun, we'll format the breaks as dollars and use the [new-as-of-{scales}-1.2.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2022/04/scales-1-2-0/) `cut_short_scale()` to shorten the values:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_log10(breaks = 500 * 2^seq(0, 9, by = 1),\n                labels = label_dollar(scale_cut = cut_short_scale())) +\n  guides(color = \"none\") +\n  labs(title = \"GDP per capita, log base 10\",\n       subtitle = \"scale_x_log10() + more logical breaks\") +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The x-axis shows logged values, but instead using the default automatic breaks at 300, 1000, etc., it has breaks at 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, etc.](index_files/figure-html/plot-log-base10-more-breaks-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='The x-axis shows logged values, but instead using the default automatic breaks at 300, 1000, etc., it has breaks at 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, etc.' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Log base $e$, or the natural log\n\nLog base 10 makes sense for visualizing things. Seeing the jumps from \\$500 → \\$1000 → \\$2000 is generally easy for people to understand (especially in today's world of exponentially growing COVID cases). When working with logged values for statistical modeling, analysts prefer to use the natural log, or log base $e$ instead. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### What the heck is $e$?\n\nHere are a bunch of helpful resources explaining what $e$ and the natural log are and why analysts use them all the time:\n\n- [Numberphile, \"e (Euler's Number)\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuA2EAgAegE)\n- [\"An intuitive guide to exponential functions and e\"](https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-guide-to-exponential-functions-e/)\n- [\"Demystifying the natural logarithm (ln)\"](https://betterexplained.com/articles/demystifying-the-natural-logarithm-ln/)\n:::\n\nThe default logging function in R, `log()`, calculates the natural log (you have to use `log10()` or `log(base = 10)` to get base 10 logs).\n\nPlotting natural logged values is a little trickier than base 10 values, since ggplot doesn't have anything like `scale_x_log_e()`. But it's still doable.\n\nFirst, we can log the value on our own and just use the default `scale_x_continuous()` for labeling:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(gapminder_2007, aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  guides(color = \"none\") +\n  labs(title = \"GDP per capita, natural log (base e)\",\n       subtitle = \"GDP per capita logged manually\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The x-axis now shows GDP per capita scaled to log base $e$, or the natural log, with axis breaks at 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
